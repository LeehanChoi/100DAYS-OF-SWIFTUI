 Swift considers decimals to be a wholly different type of data to integers, which means you can‚Äôt mix them together. After all, integers are always 100% accurate, whereas decimals are not, so Swift won‚Äôt let you put the two of them together unless you specifically ask for it to happen. */

/* Many older APIs use a slightly different way of storing decimal numbers, called CGFloat. Fortunately, Swift lets us use regular Double numbers everywhere a CGFloat is expected, so although you will see CGFloat appear from time to time you can just ignore it.
 
 In case you were curious, the reason floating-point numbers are complex is because computers are trying to use binary to store complicated numbers. For example, if you divide 1 by 3 we know you get 1/3, but that can‚Äôt be stored in binary so the system is designed to create very close approximations. It‚Äôs extremely efficient, and the error is so small it‚Äôs usually irrelevant, but at least you know why Swift doesn‚Äôt let us mix Int and Double by accident. */

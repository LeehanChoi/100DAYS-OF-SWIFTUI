/* Many older APIs use a slightly different way of storing decimal numbers, called CGFloat. Fortunately, Swift lets us use regular Double numbers everywhere a CGFloat is expected, so although you will see CGFloat appear from time to time you can just ignore it.
 
 In case you were curious, the reason floating-point numbers are complex is because computers are trying to use binary to store complicated numbers. For example, if you divide 1 by 3 we know you get 1/3, but that can‚Äôt be stored in binary so the system is designed to create very close approximations. It‚Äôs extremely efficient, and the error is so small it‚Äôs usually irrelevant, but at least you know why Swift doesn‚Äôt let us mix Int and Double by accident. */

 The two main types of numbers you‚Äôll use are called integers and doubles. Integers hold whole numbers, such as 0, 1, -100,

How can Swift be sure it‚Äôs safe to add an integer to a double ‚Äì how can it be sure you won‚Äôt lose the 0.1 or 0.5?
 
    The answer is that it can‚Äôt be safe, which is why it isn‚Äôt allowed.
